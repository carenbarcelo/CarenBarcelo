## Welcome!

With a diverse marine ecology skillset and foundation, my research is motivated by the drive to understand healthy and resilient marine ecosystems more fully across scales and trophic levels. While my research is multifaceted, I am generally focused on spatial and community ecology with an expertise in collaborating across disciplines ranging from ecology, oceanography, and ecosystem-based and climate ready fisheries management. Throughout my education and professional experiences, I have led and participated in multiple marine ecological (theoretical, statistical & field) studies ranging from the nearshore to offshore marine environments (sampling larval fish assemblages to top-predator observing, tracking, surveys and censuses) in the California Current as well as abroad (e.g. in Norway and South America). I’ve worked with a wide variety of large biotic and abiotic datasets ranging from daily to composite satellite images, multi-decadal spatially explicit fishery independent survey datasets, as well as satellite tracking of multiple individual animals at a daily scale over multiple years. I have collaborated with the NOAA-NWFSC California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment program to develop indicators of ecosystem condition along the US west coast throughout my dissertation. More recently, I coordinated the internationally collaborative Spatial Stock Assessment Methods Simulation Experiment and developed simulated Yellowfin Tuna spatial datasets using the Spatial Population Model software developed by New Zealand colleagues. I have also constructed in collaboration with colleagues, age structured population models for marine reserve specific timescale and resilience focused research. My quantitative expertise ranges from distinct formulations of statistical predictive habitat models, spatial statistics as well as multivariate non-parametric statistics commonly used in community ecology. I have used R, MATLAB (both using many associated toolboxes or packages), ArcGIS 9/10+, and GitHub among other software. Additionally, I have had training and (some) experience using the Stock Synthesis platform (SS3 & R4SS) as well as the Spatial Population Model (SPM) for developing spatially explicit stock assessments.

### Research topics
## Northern California Current
# a. Time-varying epipelagic community structure (Barceló et al. 2021 Frontiers in Marine Science)
I investigated the spatial and temporal diversity and community composition of mid- to upper trophic level species in the upper water column off of Oregon and Washington (and also went out on NOAA and chartered research vessels with NOAAs Fish Ecology Division). In a study published in Frontiers in Marine Science, I used a pelagic seascape approach to understand the epipelagic fish and macro-invertebrate assemblage structure off of Oregon and Washington using remotely sensed (MODIS-Aqua ocean color and temperature data) and in-situ biological and physical measurements (CTD data). I conducted a generalized additive mixed effects model with ordination scores as the response variable and remotely and in-situ oceanographic data in order
